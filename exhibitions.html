Seeking a new way of using art to support a cause, a group of artists in the Highlands have come together raise money for Maggie&#x27;s Centre at Raigmore Hospital by showing the effect cancer has had on their lives and their loved ones.</p><p>A new formula has been devised for The Big See which opens in June for three weeks at the Inchmore Gallery. New owner Jane Owen Inglis has agreed to make a donation for every piece of artwork sold to allow everyone to share the benefits of the show. This means that each of the 15 artists will be showing two works, one a straight donation (where the charity gets most of the money) and one on a &#x27;Business As Usual&#x27; basis which means a smaller but still significant donation goes to the charity. In addition there will be prints available, produced and mounted/framed at a discount by local business Alder Arts. All profits, after deducting costs, will go to Maggie&#x27;s.</p><p>One artist taking part is Alex Dunn, who runs a harp manufacturing business near Strathpeffer. Both he and his wife Zan have had surgery to remove tumours. He will be donating a drawing which will be priced at around £400. &quot;Although it&#x27;s an abstract work I believe someone will buy it if it&#x27;s competitively priced. At a charity show it is important to sell as much as possible.&quot; Alex has already created a link between art and illness by persuading his local surgery to make available a wall for new painting by local artists which he refreshes every few months.</p><p>A catalogue is being produced to celebrate the first show and it will contain statements by each of the artists about his/her link to cancer. They are: Clare Blois, Kirstie Cohen, Alex Dunn, Eva Faber, Michael Forbes, Colleen Godley, James Hawkins, Jennifer Houliston, Gerald Laing, Allan MacDonald, Rosie Newman, Ingeborg Smith, Erlend Tait, Pamela Tait, Eugenie Vronskaya. The original idea came from Simon Berry whose wife Colleen Godley died from thymic cancer last summer, leaving around twenty-five untitled paintings which she had never shown. &quot;I know Colleen would have been overwhelmed to have her first exhibition in the company of these artists, many of whom she admired very much,&quot; he said. &quot;During her lifetime, though, she never believed anyone would have been interested in what she painted.&quot;</p><div class="exhibition-links"><a href="http://www.inchmoregallery.co.uk">www.inchmoregallery.co.uk</a><a href="http://www.maggiescentres.org">www.maggiescentres.org</a></div></div></div><div class="catalogue-section"><h4 class="catalogue-title">From the catalogue produced for The Big See (16 June to 7 July 2012)</h4><blockquote class="catalogue-quote"><p>On behalf of Maggie&#x27;s Highlands I would like to welcome you to The Big See. Buying this catalogue will help Maggie&#x27;s provide free, comprehensive support of people affected by cancer throughout the Highlands and Islands - a big thank you. This is a different kind of fundraising art exhibition as the fourteen artists kindly donating their work have been affected by cancer in one way or another. The idea came originally from Simon Berry, after his wife Colleen died suddenly from cancer of the thymus. While Colleen was having treatment she attended our inspirational Maggie&#x27;s Centre beside Raigmore Hospital; she hadn&#x27;t shown her paintings to anyone, however after Simon showed them to some of the artists exhibiting here, the idea of The Big See was born.</p><p>I hope that you will decide to buy something from this exciting show. Whether an original or a print, we hope it will give you pleasure and may even prove an investment. It definitely will help Maggie&#x27;s forge ahead with developing the range of services we can offer to provide the support people in the Highlands who have a diagnosis of cancer, their families, friends and work colleagues tell us they need.</p><p>A huge thank you to the Inchmore Gallery, to the artists, to Simon for bringing this together and to you for supporting this exhibition.</p><footer><cite>Philippa Grant of Rothiemurchus M.B.E., Associate Board Chairwoman of Maggie&#x27;s Highlands</cite></footer></blockquote></div></article></section></div></main><footer class="footer"><p>© 2025 BelleColleen.
